 <h4>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h4>
<p>I am a Washington state-licensed attorney bringing creativity, diligence, and good humor to a human-sized law practice that serves local individuals and families.  I was born and raised in south King County, and attended the University of Washington for both undergraduate and law school.  Practicing law is one of the great privileges and joys of my life, and the people of this state made that possible by funding my public education.  In return, I continue to use my education and training the way my immigrant mother uses a paper towel: with every last fiber.<br>
<br>
I began advocating for individuals after my very first year of law school.  Over that summer I successfully represented people at risk of losing or owing thousands of dollars of unemployment insurance funds to the government.  After law school, I clerked for a local state court judge and learned lessons in trial-work that no textbook can capture.  Subsequently, I was hired by the the same agency I advocated before as a law student—the Office of Administrative Hearings.  As OAH's first-ever staff attorney, I urged the agency to live up to its legislative mandate and establish hearing procedures that are uniform and easy to understand.<br>
<br>My current role is the happy realization of my desire to escape the bureaucracy of large organizations, and get back to the people's perspective at the table.  Large organizations and businesses are frequently the pride of our American society.  But great size and power must be counterbalanced with equal checks and balances.  That is the role of plaintiff attorneys in our democratic system. It is an honor and privilege to continue to serve the good people of Washington through the developing practice areas of my law office: administrative law, personal injury, consumer protection, product liability, and employment law.
