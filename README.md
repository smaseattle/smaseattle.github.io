<h4 style="font-family: Times New Roman">11/15/2023--What is tort law?</h4>

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><em>
"If we are to keep our democracy there must be one commandment: Thou shalt not ration justice."</em> 
-Judge Learned Hand spoke these words on the 75th anniversary dinner of the Legal Aid Society of New York in 1951. 
Judge Hand served on various federal courts from 1909 to 1951.</p> 

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
The above quote is prominently featured in the American Museum of Tort Law. "Torts" is the fancy word lawyers use 
to describe lawsuits to recover compensation for harm. Reckless drivers, corporate fraudsters, abusive priests 
and imams--these are a few examples of people in society who may be held accountable by their victims through 
civil tort law. Civil law is the sole avenue in our legal system for victims of wrongdoing to directly initiate
a proceeding where they may speak about what happened to them--they can "speak" through their attorney's 
presentation of the case, and they can even take the stand and testify themselves. The case may be presented 
at trial (most likely publicly) before a judge alone, or before a judge and jury. Sometimes, clients opt to 
"settle" their case with the opposing party before the matter ever reaches trial; this is one way to potentially 
keep the details of their case out of the public forum. Some victims, however, may value precisely this very 
public nature of our courts, and the democratic nature of our jury system. An attorney must respect their client's 
desires, whether they wish to pursue trial or to settle. The law prohibits attorneys from acting in their own 
interest. An attorney may be incentivized to settle based on mismanagement of their practice or finances.  
Or they may wish to settle because they dislike trialwork. Ultimately, an attorney should not act or advise clients 
based on their own interests. They should remain clearheaded, neutral, and unafraid of oral advocacy, so that they 
readily pursue the client's best interest.

*A note on criminal versus civil Law. You may wonder: "What about criminal law? Is that not an avenue for victims?"
Criminal cases are pursued by the government against an individual or group that may have committed a crime.  
The specific victim of the crime is not a "party" to the criminal case. The government, through the form of a 
"prosecutor", ultimately has the power to bring the case or not; you as the victim have no prosecutorial power 
to bring a criminal case, no matter how egregious the harm you suffered. The outcome of a completed criminal case 
may be penalties, jail or prison, supervision, or some combination. However in a criminal case, there is no 
"remedy" strictly for the victim.
